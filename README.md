# Exploring the Nature of Black Hole Singularities: An Investigation into the Fate of an Infalling Observer

Introduction: 

It has long been known that the universe is geometric in nature. The force of gravity is nothing but
the curvature of the underlying fabric of space-time. Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity has
proved to be the cornerstone of our understanding of the universe. One of the most fascinating
predictions of the General Theory of Relativity is the existence of black holes. Black holes are
regions in space-time where the curvature is so intense that space-time is divided into two distinct
regions, separated by an event horizon. The fact that an infalling observer, once inside the event
horizon, can no longer follow a causal geodesic that leads back to the outer region results in an
inevitable encounter with the singularity, prompting us to question the nature of this experience.
At present, the majority of the scientific community believes that encountering the extreme
gravitational strength of a singularity crushes the observer completely. However, the notion of
surviving the singularity is interesting to explore, as there have been indications suggesting that
the nature of a realistic singularity could indeed be null and weak. This study aims to delve into
the question of the nature of a realistic singularity and the experience of an infalling observer in
such a black hole. Beginning with a comprehensive mathematical formulation of the gravitational
effects of a Schwarzschild black hole on an infalling observer, this study demonstrates the
existence of a strong, space-like singularity at the centre that reduces the infalling observer to zero
volume with infinite stretching along one spatial dimension and infinite crushing along the other
two dimensions. Furthermore, employing rigorous mathematical analysis, this study investigates
and establishes the genericity of a class of solutions that indicate the presence of a null and weak
spacetime singularity

Motivation for Research:

General relativity has been a well established theory for more than a hundred years, it provided a
theoretical framework that revolutionised our knowledge and understanding of the Universe to
great depths. The basis of science lies in the recognition of flaws in a theory and work towards a
more complete theory. Einstein recognized the flaws in Newton’s theory of gravity and this
motivated him to formulate his own theory of gravity, which has proved to be remarkable.
Similarly, It is well known that Einstein’s equation breaks down and yields ambiguous results in
extreme conditions of gravity, signalling the limitations of this theory. A region of such interest
is a singularity that lies within black holes. It has been long known in theory that objects such as
black holes can exist but it is now known through observational evidence that black holes do
exist. The Event Horizon Telescope was the first to capture a photograph of a black hole in 2017,
in this case the one residing at the heart of M87 Galaxy. Further, singularity theorems imply that
a singularity is expected to develop inside a black hole. Even after such strong evidence of the
existence of space-time singularities, there is very little known about them. Hence, the study of
singularities provides us with an opportunity to uncover a new layer of reality that emerges under
extreme conditions of gravity
