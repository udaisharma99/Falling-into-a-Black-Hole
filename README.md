# Exploring the Nature of Black Hole Singularities: An Investigation into the Fate of an Infalling Observer

The study aims to understand the effects of these regions of extreme gravitational strength, i.e. singularities on an extended body following a time-like
geodesic that encounters a singularity. The study answers the following questions:

1. What is the fate of an extended body as it moves along a time-like geodesic that falls into a Schwarzchild blackhole?
2. What is the nature of the singularity that lies at the centre of the Schwarzchild black hole?
3. Can Einstein’s equations yield a generic class of solutions that admit a null and weak space-time singularity?
4. What is the fate of an extended body as it moves along a time-like geodesic and falls into a null and weak space-time singularity?

Motivation for Research:

General relativity has been a well established theory for more than a hundred
years, it provided a theoretical framework that revolutionised our knowledge
and understanding of the Universe to great depths. The basis of science lies in
the recognition of flaws in a theory and work towards a more complete theory.
Einstein recognized the flaws in Newton’s theory of gravity and this motivated
him to formulate his own theory of gravity, which has proved to be remarkable.
Similarly, It is well known that Einstein’s equation breaks down and yields
ambiguous results in extreme conditions of gravity, signalling the limitations
of this theory. A region of such interest is a singularity that lies within black
holes. It has been long known in theory that objects such as black holes can
exist but it is now known through observational evidence that black holes do
exist. The Event Horizon Telescope was the first to capture a photograph of
a black hole in 2017, in this case the one residing at the heart of M87 Galaxy.
Further, singularity theorems imply that a singularity is expected to develop
inside a black hole. Even after such strong evidence of the existence of spacetime singularities, there is very little known about them. Hence, the study of
singularities provides us with an opportunity to uncover a new layer of reality
that emerges under extreme conditions of gravity

Research Approach:

The study starts with getting to grips with the calculation of tensor’s associated
with general relativity such as the Riemann curvature tensor and the Ricci tensor. Further, the geodesic equations and the geodesic deviation equations for a
radially infalling time-like geodesic are formulated to understand the behaviour
of the Jacobi fields as a body falls into a Schwarzchild singularity. The geodesic
deviation equations provide us with a set of second order differential equations
that describe the behaviour of Jacobi fields. We interpret these Jacobi fields to
form a 3-dimensional body and assess the behaviour of the individual Jacobi
fields by solving the second order differential equations which shows how the
dimensions of the body change as it moves through the geodesic falling into the
singularity. Moving ahead, through rigorous mathematical calculations using
Wolfram Mathematica this study proves the mathematical framework that describes the existence of a generic class of solutions to the Einstein field equations
that admit the presence of a null space-time singularity. The geodesic and
geodesic deviation equations are formulated in a 2-dimensional space with the
same constraints that were used to prove the existence of a weak space-time
singularity

The definition of our parameter s is such that, at s=0, the geodesic congruence
encounters a singularity. We can see that as s approaches zero, V(s) approaches
zero. Hence, as we move along the congruence, the volume encompassed by the
Jacobi fields tends to zero. For an observer falling into a black hole, we can
conclude that an observer would be crushed completely. Hence, calculating the
volume of these Jacobi fields at s=0 provides us a way to examine the nature
of the singularity. In the case of a Schwarzchild black hole, The volume goes to
zero at the point of singularity; the nature of the singularity is deemed to be
strong and space-like. Further, we can look at the individual behaviour of the
Jacobi fields at s=0 as well. Since,

We can infer that an observer falling into a Schwarzschild
black hole will be infinitely stretched along the radial direction and will be
completely crushed along the tangential and azimuthal directions. This phenomenon is called Spaghettification, where the tidal forces create a gradient of
gravitational attraction across your body. The side of the body closer to the
black hole experiences a stronger gravitational pull than the other side. This
difference in gravitational pull can stretch and compress the body

Additionally, we’ve established the presence
of a generic set of solutions to Einstein’s Field Equations. These solutions
encompass a particular class that displays a weak and null singularity at the
v=0 hypersurface. Furthermore, we’ve developed the geodesic equations and
geodesic deviation equations within a two-dimensional spatial context. These
equations pertain to the motion of a timelike geodesic as it descends towards
the v=0 hypersurface

Summary of the Research:
A cornerstone of this study lies in the insights drawn from prior research in
the realm of black hole physics and spacetime singularities. The investigation
starts with comprehending the nature of the singularity residing at the heart of
a Schwarzschild black hole, serving as a fundamental example. This exploration
then extends its reach into the focal point of this research, a more intricate and
rigorous realm of functionally generic null and weak singularities. In this part,
we proved the presence of the corresponding singularity and derived the geodesic
and geodesic deviation equations, showcasing how the geodesic congruences are
affected in regions of singularities. The heart of this study involves meticulous
mathematical analysis, drawing insights from diverse mathematical disciplines
such as tensor calculus, differential geometry, and partial differential equations.
These varied tools of mathematics are then practically employed through the
utilization of Mathematica, a user-friendly software by Wolfram that provides
an accessible means of executing computational mathematics. The objective
of this research was to fill in the mathematical propositions presented in [1], a
work that has remained unpublished. This study achieved its goal by crafting a
clear and concise formulation for these mathematical assertions. Through these
concerted efforts, this study has bridged the gap in knowledge, enriching the
discourse in this domain.
